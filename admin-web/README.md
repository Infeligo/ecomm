# Contract-Admin (part of E-Comm project)

A contract administration user interface.

Contract-Admin provides contract management by using core web services. We based it on PHP to break away from Java, which the core and some other components are written in, and to demonstration that our web services are platform-agnostic.

## Technology used

- Apache 2.4
- PHP 5.4
- Yii framework 1.1.12

## How to run

1. Install and configure PHP 5.4

2. Install Apache 2

Steps 1 and 2 for Windows users are described here:

3. Download source code and place it to Apache document root directory}.

4. Configure database connection.

5. The app ready! Open it at (like) http://localhost/admin/

Notes: The specified versions are the ones we used. The required version of PHP depends on Yii framework. See Yii documentation for compatibility info.
