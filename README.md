Distributed e-commerce system
=============================

This is a course project for IDU0210 "Hajusarhitektuurid" ("Architectures of Distributed Systems"), held at Tallinn University of Technology in autumn of 2012.

The goal is to build a system that has its components running on 4-5 separate machines. The domain (e-commerce) is given by the specification, while the choice of technology is up to the students.

Below is the (planned) list of system components:

- ./core-db - Core database (Postgres)

- ./core - Core services (Java)

- ./client-web - Contract Management web-client (PHP)

- Customer Management GUI-client (Java/Swing)

- Customer Management GUI-client's backend (Java/Swing)

- Integration component (JMS?)
