Distributed e-commerce system
=============================

This is a course project for IDU0210 "Hajusarhitektuurid" ("Architectures of Distributed Systems"), held at Tallinn University of Technology in autumn of 2012.

The goal is to build a system that has its components running on 4-5 separate machines. The domain (e-commerce) is given by the specification, while the choice of technology is up to the students.

Below is the (planned) list of system components:

- **core-db** - Core database (Postgres)

- **core-ws** - Core services (Java)

- **admin-web** - Contract Management web-client (PHP)

- **integration-client** - Customer Management GUI (Java/Swing)

- **event-monitor** - Core Event Monitoring GUI (Java/JMS/WebSockets)
